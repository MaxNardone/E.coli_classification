# E. Coli Classification Project

This project aims to classify E. coli bacteria using a machine learning model. The dataset consists of several features related to E. coli, and the target variable represents different classes for classification.

## Project Highlights

1. **Bootstrap Resampling:** Bootstrap resampling is applied to evaluate the model's robustness with a small dataset.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Features are normalized and split from the target variable for model training.

3. **Visualization:** A Seaborn pairplot is generated to explore relationships between features and the target classes.

4. **Naive Bayes Classifier:** A Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers are implemented.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated on both the original dataset and the resampled dataset to assess sensitivity to data variation.
